# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more, the system helps in early detection and preventive care.

Features:-
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
Model training using Logistic Regression
Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Comparison with other models (Random Forest, SVM)
Sample prediction for new patient data

Dataset:-
Dataset used: Heart Disease UCI Dataset
Contains medical features like:
Age
Resting Blood Pressure
Cholesterol
Chest Pain Type
Maximum Heart Rate
Fasting Blood Sugar
ECG Results
ST Depression
Target (Presence of Heart Disease)

Tech Stack:-
Python
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Models Used:-
Logistic Regression âœ…
Random Forest Classifier ðŸŒ²
Support Vector Machine (SVM) ðŸ§ 

Accuracy:-
Logistic Regression: ~85% (varies with train/test split)
Random Forest: ~90% (depending on hyperparameters)

Purpose:-
This project was created as a healthcare-focused machine learning application to showcase:
The power of data in making predictions
The use of supervised learning models for binary classification
Real-world applicability of ML in medical diagnostics
